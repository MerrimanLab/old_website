### Black Lab website

We are based in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Otago, in Dunedin, New Zealand. Our research focuses on the development and use of computational tools for the analysis of data from genomics experiments. Much of our work involves studies of human disease, but we are also involved in agricultural and horticultural research.
